# Radar-Scan-and-Object-Distance-Detection-using-JetsonNano
In this project I used Jetson Nano, Ultrasonic Sensor, SG90 Motor and few lines of codes. I will be connecting a webcam and try to take inputs from ultrasonic scanner to detect the distance of any object / image and stream the output in a mobile device.
